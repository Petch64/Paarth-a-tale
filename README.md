# Paarth-a-tale
At this point, its just placeholder code and textures but gonna release commits on me making progress in the development. also wait, i just realized i left the Undertale determination font in there.... crap



No longer being worked on cause i moved onto another engine (More specifically the FNA Reimplementation of XNA), but keeping this here anyways cause of archiving reasons.
